To do so, simply number the nodes of the tree from top to bottom, left to right, starting with one for the root, so that the nodes are numbered from 1 to n.\n","\n","We observe that the left child of node i has index 2i and the right child has index 2i + 1. The parent of node i has index ≈(i/2). We will simply store node i in slot i of an array, and we can move from a node to its parent or its children by doing simple arithmetic on the index. (We started numbering from 1 for convenience—the numbers are nicer. Of course this means that we waste slot 0 of the array—not a big problem, but it could be fixed by changing the numbering scheme slightly.)"],"metadata":{"id":"X6I0psutFhx8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Priority Queue with binary heap\n","#       A(1)    \n","#      /   \\\n","#     B(2)  C(3)  \n","#   /   \\      \\\n","#  D(4)  E(5)   F(7)\n","\n","# if (say)father=p; \n","# then left_son=(2*p); \n","# and right_son=(2*p)+1;\n","\n","class PriorityQueue():\n","  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 100\n","\n","  def __init__(self):\n","    self._data = [ None ] * PriorityQueue.DEFAULT_CAPACITY\n","    self._size = 0\n","      \n","  def __len__(self):\n","    return self._size\n","\n","  def findmin(self):\n","    if self._size == 0:\n","      raise ValueError(\"empty priority queue\")\n","    return self._data[1]\n","\n","  def insert(self, x):  #다시보기 \n","    if self._size + 1 == len(self._data):\n","      # double size of the array storing the data\n","      self._data.extend( [ None ] * len(self._data) )\n","    self._size += 1\n","    hole = self._size\n","    # self._data[0] = x\n","    # bubble up -> x를 가장 아래에 넣은 후 작은 애를 위로 올림\n","    while x < self._data[hole // 2]:\n","      self._data[hole] = self._data[hole // 2]\n","      hole //= 2\n","    self._data[hole] = x\n","    \n","  def deletemin(self):\n","    min_item = self.findmin()         # raises error if empty\n","    self._data[1] = self._data[self._size]\n","    self._size -= 1\n","    self._bubble_down(1)\n","    return min_item\n","\n","  # 'ppp' exercise\n","  def _bubble_down(self, i): # -> x를 가장 위에 넣은 후 작은 애를 위로 올림 \n","    value = self._data[i]\n","    hole = i\n","    child = self._smaller_child(hole, value)\n","    while child != 0:\n","      self._data[hole] = self._data[child]\n","      hole = child\n","      child = self._smaller_child(hole, value)\n","    self._data[hole] = value\n","\n","  # 'ppp' exercise\n","  # Is one child smaller than element's value?\n","  # Returns index of child, or 0 if no child is smaller\n","  def _smaller_child(self, index, value):\n","    if 2 * index <= self._size:\n","      child = 2 * index\n","      if child != self._size and self._data[child + 1] < self._data[child]:\n","        child += 1\n","      if self._data[child] < value:\n","        return child\n","    return 0"],"metadata":{"id":"RrgSdXaWAchc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Application of Heap"],"metadata":{"id":"-TzLJgVaB8YM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### K-th largest element"],"metadata":{"id":"UCKo8glDGlic"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Approach 1**\n","1.
